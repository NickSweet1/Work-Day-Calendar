# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a deployed web application that allows you set your schedule for the day.

## Usage

Input your tasks that need to be completed for each time slot. Using dayjs, the application will know what time of day it currently is. The application will then use three colors to signify past, present and future. Using local storage, the task that is saved will still show upon refreshing the page.
